Hello there!
======
I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), supervised by [Prof.Lei Ma](https://www.malei.org/). I received my M.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Machine Learning from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) in 2021, B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Control and Communication from [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html) in 2019. 

Research Interests
======
My primary research directions are oriented on quality, safety and security assurance for trustworthy AI systems with concretion on Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and Cyber- Cyber Systems (CCSs). My major expertise revolves around designing and developing AI-aware testing, analysis, repair and enhancement techniques to safeguard the safety, reliability, efficiency, robustness and explainability of diverse AI-enabled systems across domains (e.g., autonomous driving, energy systems and large language models, etc.).
